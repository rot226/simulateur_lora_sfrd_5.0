# FLoRa

FLoRa (Framework for LoRa) is a simulation framework for end-to-end LoRaWAN networks.
It is built on top of the OMNeT++ network simulator and reuses components from the INET framework.
The project provides modules for LoRa nodes, gateways and a network server so complete LoRa deployments can be modeled.
Application logic can be added as separate modules that communicate with the server, and adaptive data rate is supported for dynamic management of radio parameters.

Energy consumption statistics are gathered for each node and a variety of example scenarios are included.
